	<p>OVERVIEW</p>
	<p>Insomniac has conducted an in-depth review of the RFP. We understand the importance of the Survey platform and recognize ASCA’s carefully thought-out modernization vision for the platform. We fully appreciate the need for validation of best current thinking and architecture choices by way of developing a PoC. </p>
	<p>As a technology agnostic firm, we considered a number of potential solutions that would not only be best suited for the PoC but also with a vision for the fully modernized Survey Platform that is scalable, cost-effective, and aligned with the broader ASCA Enterprise Technology Strategy. In our evaluation of potential solutions, some of the key criteria considered were Associative Data Model, Data View, Object, Link, and Workflow revision capability, Data Processing &amp; Decision Automation, Scalability to accommodate changing business needs, Cutting-edge User Experience / User Interface, Modular Architecture, Integrations, Platform Extensibility, Big-Data Scale, Maintenance, Security, as well as Cost including 10-year cost of ownership. For ASCA’s benefit, we have summarized a comparison of our proposed solution to two other solutions widely available in the market (Appian and ServiceNow). You can see this comparison <a href="/ppt/slides/slide48.xml">here</a>.</p>
	<p>The following pages outline our recommendations and proposed solution in detail for all key aspects of the desired PoC elements.</p>
	<p>Last but not least, it is important to note that we have also conducted a  high-level review of the Supplemental Appendices with Epic Stacks, Requirements, User Stories. While we believe that our proposed solution and scope broadly encompasses the information contained within these appendices, there maybe specific user stories or requirements that have not yet been factored in. </p>

	<p>‹#›</p>
	<p>Submission</p>
	<p>Validation of submitted data is handled by our Orchestrations service. Validation and transform rules can be easily defined and plugged into the system by storing them in known location in the storage system. The orchestration service automatically applies rules and reject any submission that doesn’t pass the validation. Accepted submissions are moved to the next step in the data pipeline.</p>

<div class="slide-content"><p>Data Pipline? Ingestion</p>
	<p>In our proposed architecture, Ingestion is managed by the Ingestion and Orchestration services. The former service is responsible for fetching raw data from vendors and make preliminary validation checks. Ingested submissions go through a series of fully configurable validation steps that are handled by the Orchestration service:</p>
	<p>Vendors are notified of rejected submissions and can ingest a new revision of those</p>
	<p>Submissions that pass all validations are moved to the next step in the data pipeline</p>

<div class="slide-content"><p>RPA: Natural Language Processing</p>
	<p>Several questions in Blanks are “open-ended”: users’ input is basically a short text. These are complicated to handle: if we leave them as is, we risk losing valuable information. Rather, we will  employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to categorize and tag textual content entered in open-ended questions, which can eventually trigger actions (e.g. alerts) from our RPA engine.</p>

<div class="slide-content"><p>RPA: Anomaly Detection</p>
	<p>Cross Validation of Submissions</p>
	<p>One important function of the NAIC system is validation, which is responsible for ensuring the coherence and validity of entered data. A potential problem is represented by the complex nature of some financial entities, which may be interconnected: for example, corporations may be associated with multiple subsidiaries where both the corporate and the subsidiaries might submit their data to the NAIC tool. In such cases we should ensure that data submitted by linked entities are inherently coherent.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>‹#›</p>
	<p>We propose to leverage the power and flexibility of Amazon SageMaker to offer innovative validation methods.</p>
	<p>Train a suitable ML model on a subset of submissions data, e.g. one question</p>
	<p>As system data increases over time through organic data growth from use, the model becomes more accurate and is able to better reflect a correct interpretation of the complex relations between data types, for example  statutory financials, and desired forecasted variables.</p>
	<p>Even with minimal data, we can utilize models to make predictions to detect and  report anomalies in data in the system.</p>

	<p>Low-Code Application Platform</p>
	<p>One of the main issues in the current state of FDR is the updating process of Blanks, which is laborious and labor intensive for NAIC resources. Even if the changes are often very small, such as updating a single value in a form, the lift can be heavier than it should be. Our proposal enables designing Blanks to meet the NAIC specifications via the JSON schema specification used by Form Engine, and is  supported by our fully-functional Web-based UI. This enables low or zero code modifications. Updates to the blank result can be applied automatically upon form activation by an Admin. This data model makes it easy to define scripts that can be executed periodically to perform the scheduled updates without human intervention.</p>

	<p>Data provider invokes the Ingestion service (e.g. via API) with a submission in the specified data format (e.g. JSON, XBRL, etc.)</p>

	<p>Processing service checks the a data blank, validates it against the schema corresponding to the schema that the data is aligned to.</p>
	<p>Submission is added to the schema tables in the warehouse</p>
	<p>Processing service runs a set of validation / transform rules that basically brins data from “raw” to “cleaned” form.</p>
	<p>Processing service migrates clean data to a read-only storage (we propose Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL for this).</p>

<div class="slide-content"><p>Intelligent Document Processing</p>
	<p>The first two steps in the FDR data pipeline (Blanks and Vendor Prep) implies the design, preparation and exchange of a large amount of documents, some of which may be inaccurate, or incorrectly formatted. In some cases we may need to extract useful information from unstructured data sources, like documents in PDF or other formats. Extracting data from these documents may be very hard for a human, or even for an automated script, to accomplish.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>‹#›</p>
	<p>Our solution to this problem is leveraging the powerful NLP-powered tools offered by AWS platform, like Comprehend and Textract.</p>
	<p>With these tools, we can classify and extract entities from documents such as insurance claims,  mortgage packages, etc. or find relationships between  events of any given type into an article. The information extracted from these documents may be used for pre-filling Blanks and make the submission work easier to end users. </p>

<div class="slide-content"><p>Decision Support</p>
	<p>The large amount of data collected by NAIC can be used for helping managers and regulators make better decisions by leveraging powerful BI tools. A typical use case of BI is to perform analysis of historical data to explain what happened, how and why. A limitation of traditional BI tools is that they provide little insight into what “may happen” in the future.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>‹#›</p>
	<p>We propose to leverage the predictive capabilities of ML-powered algorithms to fill this gap and implement BI tools that can analyze huge amounts of historical data, identify patterns in the data and make predictions on future trends. For example, historical data for “direct losses” entities incurred into, along with other related metrics, may offer insights into what went wrong.</p>
	<p/>
	<p>The added value of ML-powered algorithms like those  that we can build with Amazon SageMaker, is the possibility of making predictions on the likelihood of future losses, something that standard BI tools cannot help with.</p>

	<p>Insomniac Design has extensive experience in building business processes, including data aggregation from multiple sources, data-driven decision-making, and handling additional metadata as part of the workflow process. We've effectively implemented workflows to solve real business problems, verifying decision points, making appropriate role assignments, and taking corrective actions on objects processed through the system.</p>
	<p>As part of a potential future vision, our proposed solution includes workflow integration with Form Engine as part of the Production implementation. </p>
	<p>As documents are ingested by Form Engine, they will be linked with data attributes (metadata), to indicate the workflow state. This approach enables the workflow engine to manage relationships between attributes in the object metadata and the objects in the workflow progression. The workflow can enables the use of metadata as decision points, and can be configured to require defined data attributes to be present at specific points in the workflow as constraints in the process.</p>

	<p>SnowFlake will be used as the Data Lake as well as Data Warehouse. We will use SnowFlake native transformations where possible, and keep a complete data lineage. Business validations or transformation rules that are too complex for built-in RedShift functions will be handled via external scripts (e.g. in Python) that are managed via AWS Managed Workflows. Likely examples of “too complex” would be data enrichment requiring external API calls or external database queries.</p>

	<p>DATA ANALYSIS</p>
	<p>Basing our data warehouse on SnowFlake brings about additional advantages in terms of data aggregation and high-level analysis, bought by the AWS platform that SnowFlake is very well integrated with. We will use SnowFlake for:</p>
	<p>storing raw submissions data, validating submissions data against blanks, applying transformations as needed. We will leverage the power of AWS Glue for this.</p>
	<p>building ML-powered algorithms to perform complex validation tasks, like anomaly detection in submitted data, for example. We will leverage the power and flexibility of SageMaker for this.</p>
	<p>building modern interactive dashboards, paginated reports, natural language queries and embedded analytics out of validated data. Amazon QuickSight will be used for this task.</p>

This document will include not only the steps to take in the case of these events but also the critical documentation, communication pathways, roles and responsibilities (RACI) and outcomes and outputs from conducting the procedure. We’ll work with NAIC to identify internal processes and procedures and devise a strategy that integrates rather than interrupts.</p>

	<p>Insomniac has conducted a high-level review of the Supplemental Appendices with Epic Stacks, Requirements, User Stories. While we believe that our proposed solution and scope broadly encompasses the information contained within these appendices, it is important to note that there maybe specific user stories or requirements that have not yet been factored in. The functional requirements read to us as Acceptance Criteria that are testable; however, we believe that a deep-dive in our proposed Discover phase is necessary to review and finalize (or add) acceptance criteria and test cases. As such, given the details provided and the limited time we have had to digest this information, and the need for deeper evaluation in collaboration with NAIC, for pricing and PoC level of effort purposes, it is to be assumed that this document is not fully representative nor reflected in the proposed budget.  </p>
	<p>NAIC to provide sample/test data for mapping documents and for testing purposes. </p>
	<p>No more than 10 templates will be designed to demonstrate potential UX/UI improvements in the modernized FDR. </p>
	<p>Insomniac has flexibility and capacity to meet NAIC’s desired timelines for completion of PoC. For the purposes of this proposal, we have developed and priced a 22 sprint plan that is intended to begin in August 2023 and conclude in May 2024. However, should NAIC desired a faster turnaround, we will be happy to work with NAIC to revise the project plan by increasing our resources and running multiple work-streams in parallel over a shorter period of time. While an example of such a project plan has been provided for illustrative purposes, the corresponding budget and specifics of work-streams will need to be developed upon NAIC’s request and in collaboration with NAIC.</p>

	<p>Insomniac has conducted a high-level review of the Supplemental Appendices with Epic Stacks, Requirements, User Stories. While we believe that our proposed solution and scope broadly encompasses the information contained within these appendices, it is important to note that there maybe specific user stories or requirements that have not yet been factored in. The functional requirements read to us as Acceptance Criteria that are testable; however, we believe that a deep-dive in our proposed Discover phase is necessary to review and finalize (or add) acceptance criteria and test cases. As such, given the details provided and the limited time we have had to digest this information, and the need for deeper evaluation in collaboration with NAIC, for pricing and PoC level of effort purposes, it is to be assumed that this document is not fully representative nor reflected in the proposed budget. During the mobilization phase, Insomniac would be happy to undertake the task of refining the user stories (based on the outcome of the PoC, writing acceptance criteria and test cases in order to develop a fully informed Road-Map. This task would need to be conducted as T&amp;M as the the level of effort is dependent on the PoC and is unknown / unclear at this time. </p>
	<p>Insomniac has flexibility and capacity to meet NAIC’s desired timelines for completion of PoC. For the purposes of this proposal, we have developed and priced a 22 sprint plan that is intended to begin in August 2024 and conclude in May 2025. However, should NAIC desired a faster turnaround, we will be happy to work with NAIC to revise the project plan by increasing our resources and running multiple work-streams in parallel over a shorter period of time. While an example of such a project plan has been provided for illustrative purposes, the corresponding budget and specifics of work-streams will need to be developed upon NAIC’s request and in collaboration with NAIC which will impact budget. This is completely optional and subject to discussion with NAIC.</p>
	<p/>
	<p>It is important to note that there may be minimal incremental cost with Snowflake, and moderate to minimal (~&lt;$5k/mo) AWS service costs. depending on how many environments and usage etc. Most things like this are able to be throttled on-demand.</p>

	<p>The project management experience and process when working with cross-organizational, cross-functional teams, is often one of the key determinants in the success of a project. In the upcoming pages, we will walk through our project management approach and governance framework, how we handle aspects of management such as governance, the SAFe® Agile framework and its various ceremonies, how we navigate and discuss risk and plan for and document change (using ITIL Change Management best practices), and how we handle resource and timeline management.</p>
	<p>Upon kickoff, we’ll work closely with NAIC to establish a productive and positive working environment to start this project off successfully.</p>
	<p>Our project management approach is founded on a comprehensive set of principles and the application of integrated processes based on industry best practices. </p>
	<p>Project planning tools such as Smartsheet, Basecamp, Jira, and the Google Suite give us the flexibility of making and documenting quick adjustments, along with an easy place for the full team to always view where we are in the project plan. The project management team will establish a regular communication cadence with the NAIC team to review project, task, and deliverables status, discuss and mitigate any emergent risks, and ask questions as they arise.</p>
	<p>Project Managers are present in all meetings to ensure that all final decisions are ground into the strategy and adhere to the project scope and timeline.</p>
	<p>We treat our projects uniquely. A granular yet flexible project approach is essential. </p>

	<p>Insomniac Design will provide program and project management and governance support that confirm to the SAFe® Scaled Agile Framework standards that NAIC conforms to for both the proof of concept and implementation phases of the FDR platform.</p>
	<p>Numerous members of Insomniac’s product and delivery teams are trained and/or certified in SAFe and scrum methodologies, and we will staff the support of this project with appropriate team members to integrate into NAIC’s SAFe operations to ensure proper and smooth alignment on any existing platforms or tools.</p>
	<p>Insomniac project management (delivery) team is able to adapt and scale our working methodology to best fit those of our clients, which also include Agile and Waterfall methodologies. We will establish ceremonies and norms using common software and platforms to track work, communicate, and share essential information.</p>
	<p>Weekly Project Team Status Meetings In addition to daily internal scrums, we recommend weekly project status meetings with NAIC. The status meeting includes team leads, NAIC project leadership as well as other stakeholders as appropriate.</p>

	<p>‹#›</p>
	<p>We will work closely with NAIC resources to plan, execute and monitor all aspects of the project including deadlines, change orders, emergencies, and resource challenges.  We will utilize SAFe form of agile project management to guide our development process while providing frequent review of deliverables and visibility into project progress. NAIC will be involved at every phase of our process and we work very closely to ensure alignment between NAIC needs and our deliverables. Insomniac Design publishes project plans and delivery (milestone) schedules for every project phase and manages and communicates updates using proper communication channels and documentation on critical discussions, decisions, and changes..</p>
	<p/>
	<p>We propose to revisit the proposed detailed project plan during the kick-off meeting and discovery phase to fine-tune the plan after we understand more about the stakeholders, critical paths, and critical dates and milestones. The project plan will be vetted with NAIC to ensure there is ample opportunity and time for NAIC to provide input and feedback at various phases. Our project plans are built to incorporate change management procedures and appropriate time gaps. We will provide weekly status reports that not only map back to the agreed upon project plan but also will identify progress-to-date, next steps, potential risks and risk mitigation strategies.</p>

<div class="slide-content"><p>RISK MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE</p>
	<p>RISK MANAGEMENT</p>
	<p>GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK</p>
	<p>Insomniac recognizes that risk is an unavoidable reality within every project, regardless of how solid an implementation plan is at the onset. So, we embrace the inevitability of risk by ensuring that when risks arise, there’s a plan to rapidly mitigate them. </p>
	<p/>
	<p>As part of our project initiation, we’ll collaboratively establish a risk management plan to prevent ambiguity or conflict later in the process when we’re working in close unison with the NAIC team. We’ll proactively identify potential risks such as scope creep, feedback/approval delay, or changes in strategy, and propose how we’ll address each should we encounter them. </p>
	<p/>
	<p>As a way to hold ourselves accountable, we’ll document all of this in our project governance plan, and actively track any risks as they’re identified and discussed in a project risk register.</p>
	<p>In addition to a solid project plan and risk management strategy, a project governance framework aligned to SAFe® Agile standards will be our best method to ensure success throughout the duration of the project’s phases. We think of it as a blueprint, or rules of engagement, that we and our clients align on. It outlines our strategic goals and project vision, as well as establishes our norms for accountability, decision-making, oversight, and stakeholder communication.</p>
	<p/>
	<p>As we kick off the POC phase of the project, we will draft a governance plan framework and share it with the NAIC team for input and alignment. We’ll ensure stakeholder input is considered, and adjust as necessary.</p>
	<p/>
	<p>Upon alignment, we’ll use this resource to onboard any project newcomers, and establish a baseline for how we’ll collaborate productively during the period of performance.</p>

<div class="slide-content"><p>IDENTIFYING PROJECT RISKS</p>
	<p>Risk #1: Additional requirements and scope creep</p>
	<p/>
	<p>Description: Although requirements have been identified in the RFP and that more concrete decisions will occur during discovery and requirements gathering, there may be instances during the performance of this project that new features/functionalities are requested by NAIC to validate.</p>
	<p/>
	<p>Probability: Low Severity: Low</p>
	<p/>
	<p>Mitigation: A robust and clear discovery phase, accompanied by documentation and a detailed technical/functional specifications document with clearly defined features and functionalities will be developed and agreed upon with NAIC Insomniac Design is a very adaptable and flexible organization and is open to managing new scope as needed. Upon identification of out of scope features, if it is determined that they are needed features to validate through the PoC, Insomniac Design will provide a quote for to assess and make a final determination. </p>
	<p>‹#›</p>
	<p>Regardless of the project, or how prepared a team is for kicking off a project, every project starts with a few inherent risks. We’ve documented those below and assessed initial risks to this project, and fortunately, have mitigation strategies for each:</p>

<div class="slide-content"><p>IDENTIFYING PROJECT RISKS (CONT’D.)</p>
	<p>‹#›</p>
	<p>Risk #3: Unexpected emergencies or shifts in priority</p>
	<p/>
	<p>Description: It is important to be aware that there is the potential for unexpected urgent situations to arise or shifts in priority that impact the project trajectory that are not within the control of NAIC or Insomniac Design.</p>
	<p/>
	<p>Probability: Low Severity: High</p>
	<p/>
	<p>Mitigation: Insomniac Design’s risk mitigation plan will include how to handle these scenarios. Throughout the project process, we will regularly meet with the NAIC team during monthly or quarterly business reviews to ensure priorities have not shifted nor any internal shifts are at risk of occurring. In the case of a change that has an impact to scope, timeline, or budget, we will initiate a change escalation and handle as amicably as possible to minimize impact to the project, the team, or when it can avoided, the scope. If a scope change is noted, the necessary stakeholders will discuss negotiations and will result in documented change notes and a decision log, and a change order, if required.</p>
	<p>Risk #2: Overlapping or delayed feedback from stakeholders and users</p>
	<p/>
	<p>Description: Multiple parties will be involved in the PoC for the modernized FDR. Sometimes we may encounter delays in receiving feedback from one or more parties and/or multiple rounds of back and forth revisions prior to approval. There may also be competing/conflicting feedback between different parties.</p>
	<p/>
	<p>Probability: Medium Severity: Low</p>
	<p/>
	<p>Mitigation: Setting clear expectations and establishing buy-in early on with a comprehensive project plan that incorporates time for feedback and revisions will mitigate most if not all issues. In addition appropriate communication channels will be established and we will work with the NAIC to determine a seamless feedback loop so that all parties operate in sync.</p>
